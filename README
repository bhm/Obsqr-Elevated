obsqr - minimalistic QR scanner for Android
===========================================

obsqr is a fast and lightweight QR scanner application for Android.

Requirements
------------

To make it run on your Android device you need to have Andoird 1.6 or higher.
Both, ARM and x86 architectures are supported.

Build
-----

obsqr uses zbar library to decode QR images, so before building obsqr you need
to install zbar first. 

To make easier, there is a helper script called 'fetch-zbar.sh':

	$ bash fetch-zbar.sh

This will fetch zbar sources from the official repository and
create symlinks to the zbar sources inside `jni` directory.

Then, update project accodring to your SDK version:

	$ android update project -p . -t <your-target>

Edit local.properties by specifying path to the NDK:

	...
	sdk.path=/path/to/sdk
	ndk.path=/path/to/ndk
	...

Finally, run ant to build obsqr:

	$ ant debug

After this step, you should get an *.apk inside the 'bin' directory.
